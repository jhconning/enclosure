    "So, to me this is in some ways a way of thinking about what might be a bit of a disconnect between the hunter-gatherer view of the commons, where there is no real need to think about how land is \"used,\" with the more amorphous concept of temporary farming, grazing, etc. on commonly owned land. In the latter case, one has to think a bit more about what happens with the land when someone goes to work it. Everyone isn't sowing a giant plot and then taking away a share of the output, after all...\n",
